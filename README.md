# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: **Siron Tommy Aban**

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.

- `places.csv` a data file for you to use.
- `places_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used in your program... it is here as a backup to copy the data
  from if you need it again.

**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?

> 12am - 11pm. 8.5 hours working and collective 3.5 hours taking a break in that timespan.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

> Not to underestimate the juggernautic size and effort needed to get an assignment done and to _REALLY_ not do it last minute.
> I struggled with implementing stuff that I was somewhat unfamiliar with such as trying to get my lists to work and append properly.
> I need to also make sure to make a list of things that are required for the final product. I often finished something and ended
> up needing to completely restart from scratch because I decided to read the assignment functionality details and had to cram
>  lines of code into my already working line of code which ends up breaking the damn thing. I struggled alot due to not fully 
> completing some week content which led me to being stumped until having to info dump myself on a weeks worth of content. I should 
> have taken Lindsay, or whomever writes the assignments warning of not doing everything all at once to heart. I need to seriously take this 
> class even more seriously.
